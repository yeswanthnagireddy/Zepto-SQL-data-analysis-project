# ðŸ›’ Zepto E-commerce SQL Data Analyst Portfolio Project
This is a complete, real-world data analyst portfolio project based on an e-commerce inventory dataset scraped from [Zepto](https://www.zeptonow.com/) â€” one of Indiaâ€™s fastest-growing quick-commerce startups. This project simulates real analyst workflows, from raw data exploration to business-focused data analysis.

## Project Overview

The goal is to simulate how actual data analysts in the e-commerce or retail industries work behind the scenes to use SQL to:

* Set up a messy, real-world e-commerce inventory **database**

* Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to explore product categories, availability, and pricing inconsistencies

* Implement **Data Cleaning** to handle null values, remove invalid entries, and convert pricing from paise to rupees

* Write **business-driven SQL queries** to derive insights around **pricing, inventory, stock availability, revenue** and more

## Dataset Overview
The dataset was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/palvinder2006/zepto-inventory-dataset/data?select=zepto_v2.csv) and was originally scraped from Zeptoâ€™s official product listings. It mimics what youâ€™d typically encounter in a real-world e-commerce inventory system.

Each row represents a unique SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) for a product. Duplicate product names exist because the same product may appear multiple times in different package sizes, weights, discounts, or categories to improve visibility â€“ exactly how real catalog data looks.

ðŸ§¾ Columns:
- **sku_id:** Unique identifier for each product entry (Synthetic Primary Key)

- **name:** Product name as it appears on the app

- **category:** Product category like Fruits, Snacks, Beverages, etc.

- **mrp:** Maximum Retail Price (originally in paise, converted to â‚¹)

- **discountPercent:** Discount applied on MRP

- **discountedSellingPrice:** Final price after discount (also converted to â‚¹)

- **availableQuantity:** Units available in inventory

- **weightInGms:** Product weight in grams

- **outOfStock:** Boolean flag indicating stock availability

- **quantity:** Number of units per package (mixed with grams for loose produce)

## Project Workflow

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of what we do in this project:

### 1. Database & Table Creation
We start by creating a SQL table with appropriate data types:

```sql
CREATE TABLE zepto (
  sku_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  category VARCHAR(120),
  name VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL,
  mrp NUMERIC(8,2),
  discountPercent NUMERIC(5,2),
  availableQuantity INTEGER,
  discountedSellingPrice NUMERIC(8,2),
  weightInGms INTEGER,
  outOfStock BOOLEAN,
  quantity INTEGER
);
```

### 2. Data Import
- Loaded CSV using pgAdmin's import feature.

 - If you're not able to use the import feature, write this code instead:
```sql
   \copy zepto(category,name,mrp,discountPercent,availableQuantity,
            discountedSellingPrice,weightInGms,outOfStock,quantity)
  FROM 'data/zepto_v2.csv' WITH (FORMAT csv, HEADER true, DELIMITER ',', QUOTE '"', ENCODING 'UTF8');
```
- Faced encoding issues (UTF-8 error), which were fixed by saving the CSV file using CSV UTF-8 format.

### 3. Data Exploration
- Counted the total number of records in the dataset

- Viewed a sample of the dataset to understand structure and content

- Checked for null values across all columns

- Identified distinct product categories available in the dataset

- Compared in-stock vs out-of-stock product counts

- Detected products present multiple times, representing different SKUs

### 4. Data Cleaning
- Identified and removed rows where MRP or discounted selling price was zero

- Converted mrp and discountedSellingPrice from paise to rupees for consistency and readability
  
### 5. Business Insights
- Found top 10 best-value products based on discount percentage

- Identified high-MRP products that are currently out of stock

- Estimated potential revenue for each product category

- Filtered expensive products (MRP > â‚¹500) with minimal discount

- Ranked top 5 categories offering highest average discounts

- Calculated price per gram to identify value-for-money products

- Grouped products based on weight into Low, Medium, and Bulk categories

- Measured total inventory weight per product category
